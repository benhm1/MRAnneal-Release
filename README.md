MRAnneal: Easy Parallel Simulated Annealing Application Development

MRAnneal provides a straightforward and flexible framework for performing
simulated annealing in parallel. It allows developers like you to focus on the details of
your particular optimization problem rather than the thorny issues of
distributed computation and inter-machine communication. MRAnneal parallelizes your
computations and returns results promptly, allowing you to not only
rapidly implement solvers, but also quickly receive the desired
results.

MRAnneal takes advantage of the MRJob framework for running applications on top
of a deployed MapReduce installation (eg: Hadoop or EC2).
